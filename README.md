## This is the base source code for my website: Shineyrock.org.

It's official! My new website is now live and can be found at: 



https://shineyrock.org



Having needed a new portfolio site I began work on my new page in early September. It's much more complicated than it needed to be, however, I wanted to challenge myself and I believe I succeeded in doing so. The technologies I used are as follows:



1. React

2. React Redux

3. React Router DOM

4. three.js

5. axios for API connectivity

6. PHP to build my simple email API



The biggest challenge I believe was learning how to integrate three.js with react, as it's not well documented how exactly that's done. However, the two work wonderfully together. Once I had that going progress sped up quite a bit, allowing me to implement more things I wanted to if for no other reason than to prove to myself that I could.



The site's features include:



1. WASD navigation among the 3d environment

2. Slight FPS based graphics scaling(highly expandable.)

3. API connectivity

4. Ability to navigate to specific 'pages' via the address bar



If you've made it this far, thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy checking out my page as much as I enjoyed building it. Until next time, everyone!
